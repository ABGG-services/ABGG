## First-timer guide

Here's what to expect at ABGG Events - Particularly handy if you're looking to join our event for the first time.

**1. Ideally, let us know you're coming - regulars by using an accurate RSVP, newcomers by posting an intro.**

Many times people can settle into a game and end up concentrating on it; so if you arrive and that's happened it's not uncommon to walk in and everyone's got their heads down -- Some people report this can be confronting, since everyone is in their own bubbles, and seemingly don't want to be disturbed; which is why we encourage new people to post in the community and let us know you're coming along as a first-timer so we can keep more of an eye out for you and ensure you're welcomed.

Let us know what games you're interested in, and it's possible others may be able to bring those games, and/or arrange a game to happen ahead of time.

If you do come in and everyone's already in a game, then please don't hesitate to pick a table, introduce yourself (at an opportune moment), and quietly spectate until a game ends and you can join in.

**2. Getting a game to the table**
The structure of our events are fairly simple -- We provide a space to play in, and invite people to fill it with games, themselves, and good times.

To participate it's a matter of finding a game, plus people to play it with, and getting it to the table!

We encourage people to arrive soon to the starting time to ensure people can settle into games expediently -- arrive too late and you may have to wait a while for other games to finish.

We'll also usually see the first games/the first hour of the event being played as lighter, filler games, in order to allow time for people to arrive, and 

**3. There are (previously) unwritten things to do for courtesy...** 

...But we have made the bold move of writing them down! üòÅ -  Our ['guide to being a courteous gamer'](courtesy.md) is essential reading for everyone.

**4. Spectate games while you wait; or if you prefer not to play at the time**
  
Quietly spectating games is allowed and encouraged, emphasis on quietly! Please do not offer unsolicited advice to players about strategy.
  
However, chiming in with/asking rules clarifications is okay as long as it's not distracting the table.
  
If you're going to watch a game for a while it's a courtesy to sit -- standing and "hovering" at a table too long can be a bit off putting.

**5. How do you buy your ticket/pay for attendance if required?**
  
Some of our events are free, and some cost - it depends predominantly on the venue and our costs to use it.
  
For those where there's a cost to attend, we try to keep it minimal, so we can have as many people as possible attend.
  
We don't have tickets, nor will you need to pay at the door - payment happens at the event, usually about mid-way through.
  
This will usually be signalled by a collection bag passed around to put your payment in.  Once your table is done with it please make sure it goes to the next table.
  
If you don't see the collection happen, or you miss it, then please be proactive about seeking out an organiser/the collection bag, and paying before leaving.
  
ABGGs payments are an honour system, and like any other honour system relies on people doing the right thing, otherwise our events could be jeopardised or we stop existing!.

**6. What games will be there?  The community decides -- so bring a game, some game, or, no games as you please.**

ABGG owns a small collection of games, including a highlighted selection of new to market titles to demo.  We try to have these at each event but can't assure that for logistical reasons.

Most of the games on any given night have been brought by attendees.  A lot of people bring a small bag with a couple games, though some bring a duffle bug, a suitcase or a plastic storage tub; and some people bring none -- all are valid.   There is no obligation to bring any games, though we very much appreciate those that do.  

There is usually a very large selection to pick from, but the nature of this also means specific titles cannot be assured to be there.  Our players are smart cookies too, and you'll notice the overall composition of the library can tend to change based on event -- a regular weekday session may lack titles that take a long time to play, but those titles make an appearance at long sessions, especially public holidays.
