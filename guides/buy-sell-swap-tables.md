# Buy/Sell/Swap Tables at ABGG events

## Overview of how it works
### General

Buy/Sell/Swap tables will only be at certain ABGG events, generally only some of our special events -- Check the event description to make sure the event will have them.

ABGG are not involved, **_at all_**, in the sales -- We cannot get involved; we take no cut; and we take no responsibility for your games or use of the tables.

### For buyers

Look out for the tables - they will be away from the general games collection people have brought to play - where you can browse the games for sale. 
Sellers will leave prices and contact details near the games, so you can get in touch with them to purchase.

* How/where to pay? Contact the seller ðŸ˜„ 
* Can you pay with cash/PayId/PayPal/Monopoly money/promises of future favours/etc? Contact the seller ðŸ˜„
* What about a trade for the game?  Contact the seller ðŸ˜„
* Are you able to open the game(s) to inspect them prior to purchase? (Yes, you really should be able to, but before you do...) Contact the seller ðŸ˜„

### For sellers

_**Check the event description before you start -- Do not attempt to set up buy/sell/swap tables at events which do not feature them**_

There will be several communal tables, away from the general games collection for people to play -- Here you can leave a collection of games, plus a note with your contact details and prices.
Look after your phone -- Buyers will contact sellers with any questions or to purchase.

Print the form in advance and fill it in with your details and pricing, then leave this with your games on the day.

* You must remain present at the event while your games occupy a table. (Stepping out briefly is fine - e.g. for a quick bite to eat)
* Make sure to clearly fill in the form with your name and contact details, so people who know to speak to to buy.
* Fair go applies -- if demand for table space is high then work together to remove larger games from the table and/or fit games on so everyone can benefit from them.
