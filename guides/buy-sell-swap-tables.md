## Overview of how it works

### For buyers

Look out for the tables  - they will be away from the general games collection people have brought to play - where you can browse the games for sale. 
Sellers will leave prices and contact details near the games, so you can get in touch with them to purchase.

### For sellers
There are several communal tables, where you can leave a collection of games, plus a note with your contact details and prices

Print the form in advance and fill it in with your details and pricing, then leave this with your games on the day.

## Rules and key information for those who wish to use our buy/sell/swap tables.

1. ABGG are not involved, **_at all_**, in your sale -- We cannot get involved; we take no cut; and we take no responsibility for your games or use of the tables.
2. You must remain present at the event while your games occupy a table. (Stepping out briefly is fine - e.g. for a quick bite to eat)
3. Make sure to clearly fill in the form with your name and contact details, so people who know to speak to to buy.
4. Fair go applies -- if demand for table space is high then work together to remove larger games from the table and/or fit games on so everyone can benefit from them.
