# ABGG Online Game Night - Thursday Fortnightly From 7PM!

Online gaming has expanded in the last few years with a huge number of games available.
ABGG's online gaming sessions are a great way to connect with others and discover new games that you haven't had the chance to try before!

To play games online we use Boardgame Arena (BGA) and Discord for voice chat.

To get started, you will need to [sign up to Boardgame Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/). 
Boardgame Arena is a free browser based website with hundreds of boardgames available to play.

Once you've signed up, [join the ABGG group](https://boardgamearena.com/group?id=3460147).

You will also need a headset for voice chat and Discord installed.
Discord is a free program for online text and voice chat. [You can download Discord here](https://discord.com/).
Once installed, [follow this link to join the ABGG Discord server](https://discord.gg/KYXmAHGrBk?event=1341271196238614640).
